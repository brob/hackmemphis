  HACKmemphis is an organization that hosts a weekend hackathon event. We
  encourage developers and designers of any background (or technology) to come
  together to work on whatever projects interest them. HACKmemphis is a free
  form weekend of hacking on software and hardware projects.


  HACKmemphis is organized by a group in Memphis comprised of developers,
  makers, hackers, and local tech community supporters. We all want to see the
  local tech scene in Memphis thrive. We are a mutual nonprofit organization.
  This is a nonprofit venture. All money raised goes directly into creating the
  best event possible.
